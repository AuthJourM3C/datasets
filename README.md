# datasets
This repository contains a set of datasets used for environmental sound classification tasks

**UrESC22**
This dataset is used for the task of air-pollution source detection from audio footprints. 

**UrANP dataset**
This dataset is used for the task of air-pollution source detection from audio footprints. This is an extension of UrESC22 containing a total of 8,5 hours audio clips, splitted in two classes: (a) related to source of air pollution (R) and (b) not related to source of air pollution (NR). 

**LVLib SMO v1 dataset**
Dataset for General Audio Classification. This dataset follows a three-class classification scheme, according to the Speech/Music/Other (SMO) taxonomy.

**LVLib SMO v2 dataset**
Dataset for General Audio Classification. Aiming at creating a large, yet compact, database for facilitating deep learning demands, the original LVLib SMO v1 has been expanded by embedding the GTZAN Music Genre and AESDD repositories to Music and Speech classes respectively.

**LVLib SMO v3 dataset**
Dataset for General Audio Classification. This dataset is formulated to expose data normalization issues in CNN topologies. It is an exact copy of the LVLib-SMO-v1, but with partially modified gain.

**LVLib SMO v3 dataset**
Dataset for General Audio Classification. LVLib-v4 follows the same 3-class scheme as the LVLib SMO family but featuring data deformations: variable gain and additive noise.

**BDLib v1 dataset**
BDLib v1 is a collection of sounds for the task of Environmental Sound Recognition. The library is organized in the following 10 classes: airplanes, alarms, applause,birds, dogs, motorcycles, rain, rivers, sea waves, and thunders.

**BDLib v2 dataset**
BDLib v2 (an extension to BDLib v1) is a collection of sounds for the task of Environmental Sound Recognition. The library is organized in the following 10 classes: airplanes, alarms, applause,birds, dogs, motorcycles, rain, rivers, sea waves, and thunders.
